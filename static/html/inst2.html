        <h1>Test Instructions</h1>
        <p>Thank you for your participation in this BrainGame.<br />Before we will start the test,
          please read these test instructions carefully.</p>

            <h2>What is a Braingame?</h2>
            <p>Braingames use research techniques from cognitive science to better understand how our minds work when using the web. That understanding can improve web experiences by tailoring them around data contributed through your participation.</p>
            <p class="thick">Please do NOT do any of the following things, or you will be disqualified to prevent incorrect test results:</p>
            <ul class="instructions">
                <li>Switch tabs or programs during the test</li>
                <li>Zoom in or out during the test</li>
                <li>Reload the page once you have begun the test</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h2>The training</h2>
            <p>In this experiment, you will load websites under different speed conditions.
            After each trial, we'll ask you to rate the previous page load experience on a scale from “slowest experience” to “fastest experience”.</p>
            <p>To familiarize yourself with the different conditions, we will run a training session before the actual test. During the training,
            you will experience the full range of page load experiences.</p>
            <p>Although we will ask you to rate each trial, do not worry about your rating score. Try to answer with what feals like a fast or a slow
            page load experience for you. There is no right or wrong. The training segment of the test can help you determine what "fast" or "slow" feels like to you.
            Trying to be asconsistent as possible in your ratings during the test is all that we ask from you.</p>
        </section>

            <h2>The task</h2>
            <p>Some pages will show photos of a football player, and some pages will show photos of a red bag. Please count how often you see the picture of the football player or the picture of the red bag.</p>
            <div style="block">
                <img id="football" style="float:left;width:280px;height:160px;margin:10px" src="static/img/coutinho.jpg" />
                <img id="bag" style="float:left;width:280px;height:160px;margin:10px" src="static/img/bag.jpg" />

          <h2>The test</h2>
          <p>During this test, you will rate several page load trials, and do not forget to count the football player or the red bag.</p>
